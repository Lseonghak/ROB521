% This assignment will introduce you to the idea of motion planning for  
% holonomic robots that can move in any direction and change direction of 
% motion instantaneously.  Although unrealistic, it can work quite well for
% complex large scale planning.  You will generate mazes to plan through 
% and employ the PRM algorithm presented in lecture as well as any 
% variations you can invent in the later sections.
% 
% There are three questions to complete (5 marks each):
%
%    Question 1: implement the PRM algorithm to construct a graph
%    connecting start to finish nodes.
%    Question 2: find the shortest path over the graph by implementing the
%    Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.
%    Question 3: identify sampling, connection or collision checking 
%    strategies that can reduce runtime for mazes.
%
% Fill in the required sections of this script with your code, run it to
% generate the requested plots, then paste the plots into a short report
% that includes a few comments about what you've observed.  Append your
% version of this script to the report.  Hand in the report as a PDF file.

% Maze Generation
% ==========================
%
% The maze function returns a map object with all of the edges in the maze.
% Each row of the map structure draws a single line of the maze.  The
% function returns the lines with coordinates [x1 y1 x2 y2].
% Bottom left corner of maze is [0.5 0.5], 
% Top right corner is [col+0.5 row+0.5]
%

row = 5; % Maze rows
col = 7; % Maze columns
map = maze(row,col); % Creates the maze
start = [0.5, 1.0]; % Start at the bottom left
finish = [col+0.5, row]; % Finish at the top right

% Question 1: construct a PRM connecting start and finish
% ======================================================
%
% Using 500 samples, construct a PRM graph whose milestones stay at least 
% 0.1 units away from all walls, using the MinDist2Edges function provided for 
% collision detection.  Use a nearest neighbour connection strategy and the 
% CheckCollision function provided for collision checking, and find an 
% appropriate number of connections to ensure a connection from  start to 
% finish with high probability.


% variables to store PRM components
nS = 500;  % number of samples to try for milestone creation
milestones = [start; finish];  % each row is a point [x y] in feasible space
edges = [];  % each row is should be an edge of the form [x1 y1 x2 y2]

% generate samples

% =================================================================
% Question 2: Find the shortest path over the PRM graph
% =================================================================
%
% Using an optimal graph search method (Dijkstra's or A*) , find the 
% shortest path across the graph generated.  Please code your own 
% implementation instead of using any built in functions.

% ================================================================
